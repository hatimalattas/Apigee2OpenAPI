# Apigee2OpenAPI Documentation

## Introduction

The **Apigee2OpenAPI** tool is designed to parse the Apigee Proxy Bundle and generate corresponding OpenAPI specifications.

## How It Works

### 1. Input

The tool expects a zipped Apigee Proxy Bundle as its primary input. This bundle, which is in the form of a compressed `.zip` file, contains XML configurations and related files that define the API's endpoints, methods, parameters, responses, and more.

### 2. Parse Proxy Endpoint to Construct OpenAPI Paths, Parameters, and Methods

The tool parses the "Request Proxy Endpoint" flows. From the "Request Proxy Endpoint" flow, it constructs the OpenAPI Spec paths, parameters, and the HTTP method associated with each endpoint. Various input types are identified and extracted, including:

- Query parameters
- Path parameters
- JSON payloads

The differentiation between optional and required fields is based on the value of the `IgnoreUnresolvedVariables` element within the "Extract Variables Policies":

- If `IgnoreUnresolvedVariables` is set to `true`, the field is considered optional.

```xml
<ExtractVariables name="ExtractVariables-2">
   <DisplayName>Extract a value from a query parameter</DisplayName>
   <Source>request</Source>
   <QueryParam name="code">
      <Pattern ignoreCase="true">DBN{dbncode}</Pattern>
   </QueryParam>
   <VariablePrefix>queryinfo</VariablePrefix>
   <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
</ExtractVariables>
```
- If `IgnoreUnresolvedVariables` is set to `false`, the field is considered required.
```xml
<ExtractVariables name="ExtractVariables-2">
   <DisplayName>Extract a value from a query parameter</DisplayName>
   <Source>request</Source>
   <QueryParam name="code">
      <Pattern ignoreCase="true">DBN{dbncode}</Pattern>
   </QueryParam>
   <VariablePrefix>queryinfo</VariablePrefix>
   <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
</ExtractVariables>
```

> **Note**: If an endpoint contains both optional and required fields, there must be two separate "Extract Variables Policies" attached to the "Proxy Endpoint Request" flow â€” one with `IgnoreUnresolvedVariables` set to `true` (for optional fields) and another with `IgnoreUnresolvedVariables` set to `false` (for required fields).

In addition to parsing standard parameters, the tool specifically extracts and utilizes `description` and `placeholder` attributes. This functionality enriches the OpenAPI specification with detailed descriptions and sample values for various parameters.

Here is an example of how the tool processes these attributes:

```xml
<ExtractVariables async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Extract-Date-Range-Query">
    <DisplayName>Extract Date Range Query</DisplayName>
    <QueryParam name="start_date" description="This parameter specifies the beginning of the time period for which you want to retrieve manager's timesheets. The value should be provided in a standard date format MM/DD/YYYY." placeholder="01/01/2022">
        <Pattern ignoreCase="true">{start_date}</Pattern>
    </QueryParam>
    <QueryParam name="end_date" description="This parameter defines the end of the time period for querying manager's timesheets. Similar to the start_date parameter, the date should be in a standard format." placeholder="12/29/2023">
        <Pattern ignoreCase="true">{end_date}</Pattern>
    </QueryParam>
    <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
</ExtractVariables>
```

In this ExtractVariables policy, the tool extracts the descriptions and placeholders for start_date and end_date query parameters. These details are then incorporated into the OpenAPI specification to provide clear documentation and examples for API consumers.

### 3. Parse AssignMessage Policy to Construct OpenAPI Response Schemas
The tool parses the "AssignMessage" policy within the "Proxy Endpoint Response Flow". To be considered for parsing, the name of the "AssignMessage" policy must contain the term "OAS". The identified "AssignMessage" policy contains a mock response, which the tool uses to build the corresponding response schema for the OpenAPI specification.

For example, here's a sample `AssignMessage` policy that the tool would parse:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<AssignMessage async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="false" name="OAS">
    <DisplayName>OAS</DisplayName>
    <Set>
        <Payload contentType="application/json">
            {"name":"foo", "type":"bar"}
        </Payload>
    </Set>
    <Source clearPayload="false">response</Source>
</AssignMessage>
```

>**Note**: Ensure that this policy is disabled in the actual flow, as it's meant for schema generation purposes and not for actual runtime behavior.

### 4. Parse RaiseFault Policy in Proxy Endpoint

The tool also analyzes the "RaiseFault" policies within the Proxy Endpoint. These policies are typically used to handle error conditions in Apigee API proxies. By parsing these policies, the tool can accurately represent error responses in the generated OpenAPI specification.

Here is an example of a `RaiseFault` policy that the tool would parse:

```xml
<RaiseFault async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Raise-Missing-Date-Range">
    <DisplayName>Raise Missing Date Range</DisplayName>
    <FaultResponse>
        <AssignVariable>
            <Name>error_message</Name>
            <Value>Missing Date Parameters.</Value>
        </AssignVariable>
        <AssignVariable>
            <Name>error_code</Name>
            <Value>400</Value>
        </AssignVariable>
    </FaultResponse>
</RaiseFault>
```

### 5. Authentication
The tool requires the authentication type to be defined in GitLab CI/CD variables. The variable's key name should be `AUTH`. Supported values include:

- `oauth2`
- `apiKey`
- `basic`

Based on the specified authentication type, the tool will set up the appropriate security schemes in the OpenAPI specification.

### 6. Base URL Configuration
This tool is designed to be executed within GitLab's CI/CD environment. One of its features is dynamically configuring the base URL within the generated OpenAPI specification, based on the branch in which the CI/CD pipeline is executed.

For instance:
- If the pipeline is executed in the `development` branch, the base URL within the OpenAPI spec will be set to `api-dev.example.com`.
- If the pipeline is executed in the `test` branch, the base URL within the OpenAPI spec will be set to `api-test.example.com`.
- If the pipeline is executed in the `staging` branch, the base URL within the OpenAPI spec will be set to `api-stg.example.com`.
- If the pipeline is executed in the `main` branch, the base URL within the OpenAPI spec will be set to `api.example.com`.

It's essential to ensure that the CI/CD pipeline's branch context aligns with the desired environment for accurate base URL configuration in the OpenAPI spec.

### Local Setup and Execution Outside GitLab CI/CD

If you need to run `apigee2openapi` on your local machine outside the GitLab CI/CD environment, follow the steps below:

#### Setup
1. **Clone the Project:**
   Clone `apigee2openapi` to your local machine.

2. **Install Node.js:**
   Ensure that Node.js is installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
```bash
   $ npm install --dev
```

### Run the Tool Locally
1. Download the proxy bundle from the Edge instance.
2. Execute the following command, replacing the placeholders with your specific file paths and API details:
```bash
    $ node apigee2openapi.js -d /Users/hatimalattas/Downloads -l ../../Downloads/api-gateway_rev45_2023_03_14.zip -n api-gateway -e https://api-test.example.com -a oauth2
```

- -d, --destination <file>, API Bundle destination location.
- -l, --local <file>, Use local API bundle.
- -n, --name <API name>, API proxy name.
- -e, --endpoint <API proxy endpoint>, API proxy endpoint e.g. https://api.example.com.
- -a, --auth <type>, Specify the authentication type (basic, apiKey, oauth2, none).


## Conclusion
Apigee2OpenAPI simplifies the process of generating OpenAPI specifications from Apigee Proxy Bundles. By automating this conversion, developers can focus on creating and enhancing APIs rather than manually writing specifications. This tool is especially beneficial in CI/CD pipelines, promoting consistency and efficiency in developing and documenting APIs.
